# freenet-xmpp

This code is only here as a reference. It was written back in 2009 as
part of the master theses "Growing secure P2P networks". The code has
not been changed since.


The code in se/su/it/smack/ is a heavily modified version of the su-smack
library. This library doesn't seem to have any web page that is online,
previously it was located at http://static.devel.it.su.se/su-smack/. The
code in src/org/xmpull is taken from the [xmlpull](http://www.xmlpull.org/)-library.
